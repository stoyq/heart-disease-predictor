    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The City of Vancouver maintains thousands of water (fire) hydrants across the city. These hydrants vary in installation year, flow-rate (represented by color), and operational status.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective \n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a prediction model that recommends new hydrant installation locations across Vancouver.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "This dataset contains the geographic coordinates and attributes of all existing hydrants in Vancouver. Using this historical installation data, we can analyze spatial patterns and build a machine-learning model to identify which areas of the city are most likely candidates for future hydrant installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "We aim to identify the most likely area in Vancouver for installing a new hydrant using a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) prediction model built from historical hydrant locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "We downloaded the dataset from the City of Vancouver Open Data Portal.\n",
