    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally, and early detection is critical for prevention and treatment. In this project, we use the UCI Heart Disease dataset to build a machine-learning model that predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on clinical and physiological attributes. We load the dataset directly from the web, clean and wrangle the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and train a classification model (Decision Tree) to identify important predictors of heart disease. Our results highlight key risk indicators that align with well-known medical knowledge, demonstrating how machine learning can support early screening and clinical decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction \n",
    "The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that determines whether a patient is at risk of heart disease using a set of clinical measurements. Heart disease diagnoses often rely on many interacting factors such as chest pain symptoms, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and exercise response. Machine-learning models can help uncover patterns in these variables and support early identification of high-risk patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research question is:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Given a patient’s clinical and physiological attributes, can we accurately predict whether they have heart disease?”\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we use the publicly available Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains multiple medically relevant variables, making it suitable for a classification model such as a Decision Tree.\n",
